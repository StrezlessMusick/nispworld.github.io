  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Air Plan defines in sufficient detail how COM JFAC plans to use air forces to achieve his objectives and effects. The Air Plan is frequently referred to as the Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP). COM JFAC will translate JFC/COM NRF objectives and effects into an Air Plan, which may take the form of a Supporting Plan (SUPLAN) or an Annex to the OPLAN. In accordance with this Air Plan, COM JFAC will issue a daily (or periodic) Air Operations Directive. In addition, the Air Plan  a. Harmonises the aerospace control, force application, and force enhancement roles, and integrates the efforts of the air assets of the other Component Commanders; the Air Plan is instrumental in achieving the joint objectives and desired effects; b. Identifies target sets or categories and levels of destruction or effect desired in as much detail as time and available intelligence information allows; c. Prioritises the targets that are assigned to ACC and provides an estimate on the time required to achieve the desired results and effects; d. Outlines levels of effort to be used on targets, as a basis for the apportionment recommendation; e. Indicates phasing and synchronisation of the operation; air mission phasing and synchronisation as mentioned in the Air Plan follows from the phasing and synchronisation in the Joint OPLAN; f. Identifies the air effects that contribute to the achievement of the joint operational effects required to achieve the Joint Force Commanderâ€™s End State; in addition, the means to achieve the air effects and the metrics to measure effectiveness and performance are identified. g. Indicates force requirements necessary to accomplish the planned missions; as the requirements for each aerospace control and force application mission are determined, the level of effort is translated into the desired aircraft types and numbers; these numbers and the planned employment concepts will determine the types and size of combat force support and force multipliers.</p>
