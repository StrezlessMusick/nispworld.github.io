  <dd class="data-value"><p>The NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) is a continuous process which NATO utilizes to influence member nations to allocate, when required, forces with the required capabilities to the Alliance capable of successfully accomplishing its missions. In addition to the member nations arsenals, there are some areas where NATO as an owner develops its own capabilities, such as the NATO Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control AEW&amp;C Force. The main actors in Defence Planning (DP) in NATO are the [[International Staff]] (IS), [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT) and the NATO member nations. Important advice is being given by the International Military Staff (IMS) and [[Allied Command Operations]] (ACO). Defense Planning is done at Alliance level for the following reasons. * The Allies have a large pool of forces which is collectively bigger and better than current possible adversaries. Nevertheless a considerable number of these capabilities are legacy and not designed for modern, rapid, multinational and expeditionary operations. * Many nations have national priorities which often conflict with those of the Alliance. Where it comes to Defence Cost, NATO seeks to create a balanced burden sharing among its member states. This is worked out on the principle of fair burden sharing. To accomplish this, NATO clearly needs to have some sort of process for Defence Planning. * Given reduced overall force levels and constrained resources, the ability to harmonize national and NATO defence planning, including exchanges of information among the Allies about their force plans, will remain vital for ensuring the preparedness of the forces and supporting structures to carry out the full spectrum of Alliance missions. The aim of collective DP is to ‘‘provide a framework’’, within which national and NATO Defence Planning can be ‘‘harmonized to meet the Alliances agreed military requirements’’, (which includes support for EU-led operations), in the most effective way. Collective defence planning in the Alliance supports the arrangements that enable member countries to enjoy the crucial political, military and resource advantages of collective defence through the exchange of information, to mutual and collaborative requirements programmes ‘‘needed for modern, rapid, multinational and expeditionary operations’’. NATO DP seeks to prevent the re-nationalization of defence policies and to identify and encourage effective use of resources, while at the same time retaining national sovereignty, all within the framework of the NATO Treaty. Planning horizons for requirements derivation include short(0-6 years), medium (6-15 years) and long-term (15 years and beyond).</p>
