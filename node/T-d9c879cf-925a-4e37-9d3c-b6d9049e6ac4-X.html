  <dd class="data-value"><p>Joint Targeting is the process of determining the effects necessary to achieve the commander’s objectives, identifying the actions necessary to create the desired effects based on means available, selecting and prioritizing targets, and the synchronization of fires with other military capabilities and then assessing their cumulative effectiveness and taking remedial action if necessary. It is both an operational level and component level command function. The Joint Targeting Cycle (JTC) has a logical progression that aids decision-making and provides the JFC with a methodology linking objectives with effects throughout the battlespace. It is flexible enough to be adapted to any military operation desired and across diverse functional areas, such as air interdiction and information operations. This process enables the JFC to most effectively employ allocated resources to achieve the assigned objectives. Joint forces require a common joint targeting process in order to minimize the likelihood of conflicting or duplicative actions during military operations, as well as to mitigate potentially undesirable consequences resulting from the outcome of those operations. Consequently, components must understand the joint targeting process if they are to create the effects necessary to accomplish the JFC’s objectives. A common understanding of the joint targeting process and adherence to its principles among joint force staff and subordinate component staffs ability to  * Ensure JFC compliance with NAC, MC and SC guidance and instructions; * Comply with JFC objectives, guidance, and intent; * Focus on adversary’s centres of gravity (COG) and related decisive points (DPs); * Coordinate, synchronize, and de-conflict actions; * Rapidly respond to targets that present limited opportunities for action; * As resources permit, assign the most appropriate means to the proposed target; * Minimize duplication of effort; * Expedite assessment of executed operations; * Provide a common perspective on all targeting efforts performed in support of the commander; and * Fully integrate all capabilities. The joint targeting cycle consists of six phases. The phases are built upon the principles of effective and efficient joint targeting. The cycle focuses targeting options on the JFC’s objectives for operations, while diminishing the likelihood of undesirable consequences    Phase 1 - Analysis of the JFC’s Objectives, Guidance, and Intent;   Phase 2 - Target Development, Validation, Nomination, and Prioritisation;   Phase 3 - Capabilities Analysis;   Phase 4 - Force Planning and Assignment;   Phase 5 - Mission Planning and Force Execution;   Phase 6 - Assessment The Joint Force Commander establishes a Joint Coordination Board at the appropriate JFC HQ for campaign synchronization and joint targeting review and approval. Also, at the appropriate JFC HQ, a Joint Targeting Coordination Board (JTCB) is formed. For different phases of a campaign, the JCB amplifies the JFC’s Direction and Guidance into a series of Joint Coordination Orders (JCO) that are iteratively refined between JCB and the JTCB. At the start of the new campaign, NATO requests potential targets in the area of interest from various NATO nations. SHAPE allocates these potential targets into an Integrated Database (IDB). JTCB creates an initial Joint Target List (JTL) from IDB. JTL is maintained by JTCB through continuing liaison and co-ordination with the JCB and CC HQs. At the same time, JTCB maintains mobile targets in Mobile Target List (MTL) within JTL. The JTL is used for the development of targets including production of target materials in target folders. For each phase of a campaign, using the JCO for guidance, the JTCB produces the Joint Prioritized Target List (JPTL) where the targets have been coordinated and de-conflicted with all SRCs and relevant organizations of the joint force. The JPTL is submitted to the JCB for review and the JFC’s approval. JCB maintains a list of targets that are no-strike (prohibited) or restricted, the No-Strike Target List (NSL) and Restricted Targets List (RTL); and assures that those are annotated as restricted or no-strike within JTL. These targets may not be included in a JPTL unless restrictions have been removed as a result of review process. JPTL is then divided by the JTCB or sub-group of JTCB into a number of Prioritized Target Lists (PTL) that are used by individual subordinate formations for attack. Force components and SRCs can nominate targets to JTCB for inclusion into the JTL via Target Nomination Lists (TNL). JTCB reviews and combines TNLs. Planning cells shall plan missions against targets in their assigned PTLs using target details.</p>
