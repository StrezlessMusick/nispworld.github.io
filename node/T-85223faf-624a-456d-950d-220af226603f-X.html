  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Federated Address Assignment Process defines standard steps to be performed by Mission Network (MN) Participants and Service Management Authorities (SMA) required to assign IP address ranges (and ASN) in a federation. * MN Participants need to have a Unique IP address range, this could be either public IPv4 space registered with IANA and communicated to the SMA or private IPv4 space that is agreed by the SMA. The SMA will determine if there are any overlaps between MN Participants and recommend changes. * MNE Providers need to have a Unique BGP ASN number, known to the Mission as the ASN for that MNE Provider ** If a MNE Provider has public assigned ASNs, this needs to be communicated to the SMA. ** In case MNE Providers have Private ASNs, the SMA needs to be notified to ensure that there are no conflicts <em>** If Private ASNs overlap with an already private assigned ASN by the SMA , then they need to change to a new SMA issued Private ASN **</em> If PrivateASNs do not overlap with any other SMA assigned private ASN, it is marked, recorded and accepted The process for IPv4 address space is identical to the ASN process as outlined above ** NOTE  MNE Providers might not be able to consolidate their own networks (e.g. Army, Navy, Airforce), this resulted in fragmented networks. In this situation a MNE Provider must confederate multiple internal ASN’s ( also called Sub ASN’s) under one confederate ASN which is the SMA assigned Mission ASN for that MNE Provider. To shorten this process and to allow pre-configuration of equipment, all FMN Affiliates should perform this process as part of the FMN Framework activities.</p>
