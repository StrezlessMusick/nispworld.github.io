  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Operational Planning Processes (OPP) Courses of Action (COA) Analysis Process supports the refinement and analysis of the COAs received from the JFC’s decision on the tentative COAs in the previous step. The final product of this process is a series of COAs derived from a comprehensive, logical cross-functional evaluation and synchronization. This series is then ready for comparison and validation in the next step. Course of action analysis will partly be a collaborative planning effort between the operational-level and the tactical level planners to produce coordinated COAs for each level. COA analysis begins with a review of the JFC’s accepted and additional COAs as a basis for further refinement. The focus is on scrutinizing the initial COAs in a cross-functional manner by the entire staff. These COAs are also coordinated with subordinate commands and refined through their analysis. Finally they are evaluated by means of war gaming and synchronized. If required, the planners further refine the COAs by adding the level of detail required for further analysis, war gaming and evaluation.</p>
