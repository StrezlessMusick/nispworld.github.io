  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Joint Fires processes provides the ability to use kinetic and non-kinetic means in all environments to generate the desired lethal and/or non-lethal effects from all domains and the information environment. To employ lethal and nonlethal means to defeat enemy forces or to maintain freedom of movement. Operational firepower is by its nature, primarily a joint/multinational task. Firepower refers to the delivery of all types of ordnance to include bombs, rockets, missiles, and artillery as well as other nonlethal means against enemy targets at operational depths. The two broad categories of targets are planned and immediate. Planned targets are targets that are known to exist in an operational area and against which attacks have been scheduled in advance or are on-call. Immediate targets, either unplanned or unanticipated, are targets that have been identified too late to be included in the normal targeting process, and therefore, have not been scheduled.</p>
