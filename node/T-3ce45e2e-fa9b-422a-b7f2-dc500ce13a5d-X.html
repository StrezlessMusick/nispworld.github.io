  <dd class="data-value"><p>The requirement to establish an Operations Planning Environment to support the exchange of information between the planning staffs of the Strategic and Lead Operational Commander and those of the FMN Affiliates contributing troops to a new mission will depend on the nature and composition of the operation. In a NATO context the existing peacetime infrastructure will be used if the mission only consists of NATO nations. If however non-NATO nations are involved as Mission Network participants then a separate enclave will be created within the existing peacetime network infrastructure. This operations planning environment will typically be planned and prepared during the development of Military Response Options and actively used to develop the CONOPs, the Operations Plan and to support Force Generation. The Operations Planning Environment should makes use of the extant FMN Instructions and Service Catalogue at inception , especially those parts of the FMN Instructions relevant for CONOPS/OPLAN Development Phase (e.g. the FMN Planning Information Templates). The termination of the operations planning environment will typically be at the NAC approval of the OPLAN, after which all planning and situational awareness information will be transferred via cross environment information exchange to the Mission Execution Environment - which will also have been activated by this point. The information exchange will be enabled if the Operations Planning Environment also has made use of the FMN Planning Information Templates and FMN services and standards.</p>
