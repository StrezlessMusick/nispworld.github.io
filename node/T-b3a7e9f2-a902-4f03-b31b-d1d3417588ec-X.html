  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Operational Planning Processes (OPP) Courses of Action (COA) Development Process supports the development of a set of tentative COAs, all of which will accomplish the mission effectively in accordance with the commander’s intent. This process may be a collaborative planning effort between the strategic and the operational-level planners to produce coherent broad COAs for each level, in order to preserve a common context during the further development steps. The prerequisites for the commencement of this phase in Operational Planning are  the JFC’s approved mission analysis and operational design; and his planning guidance, including his commander’s initial intent and his guidance for COA development and selection. COA development begins with a review of JFC’s planning guidance, produced in the previous step, as a basis for updating functional staff checks and analyses as required. The focus is on developing tentative COAs starting with the opponents’ COAs, which have to be taken into account accordingly. Initially, they are all described in broad terms and later on they are tested for viability.</p>
