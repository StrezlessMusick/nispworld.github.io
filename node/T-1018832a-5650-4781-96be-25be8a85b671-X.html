  <dd class="data-value"><p>; OLCM_1 Provide OLCM Capability ‘'’UBPM v2.1’’’  The OLCM capability must be adaptable to different types of operation and function in all phases of NATO operations and across a network of interacting NATO, National and civilian Operations Logistics Chain OLCs. It must provide  *Logistic visibility including precise information and status on mission essential or critical logistics resources (e.g. capabilities &amp; facilities), requirements and processes as planned. *Logistic management and decision support for the responsible NATO logisticians (e.g. CJ4, JLSG) over NATO committed logistics resources, logistics requirements and logistics processes. The processes associated to the management of the Operations Logistics Chain will include maintenance of the capability between operations, its initialization for a specific operation, provision of Logistics visibility, provision of management functions (including coordination with National and civilian logistics chains) and closure of operation specific logistics chain. [Reference OLCM CONOPS, OLCM MMR] The OLCM Capability is responsible for providing this visibility to NATO Commanders, CJ4s and their staffs to enable collaboration of the various actors for planing, prioritising, synchronising and coordinating logistic operations operating within a network of NATO, national and Host Nation (HN) logistic chains. The OLCM cycle deployment, sustainment and redeployment comprises 5 stages. *The 1st stage is the maintenance of the OLCM capability. This maps against the Enduring Management timeframe identified above. *Second stage is when NATO decides to plan for an operation and LOG FS - as the collection of User Applications enabling the OLCM Capability - needs to be initialised and configured according to the characteristics of the operation. When the operation is launched - stages three and four - there is a need to  *Manage the logistics information to build the recognized logistics picture. This is done through near-real time collection of logistics data from the co-existing NATO and National logistics chains and logistics reporting. *Manage the Operation Logistics Chain; the real value of OLCM manifests itself when an event occurs that requires decisions to be made and actions to be taken, either to manage assigned resources and services or to request additional ones. *At the end of the operation, the OLCM processes feed in the lessons learned process and in the knowledge base of the Core OLCM Capability, after which the OLC is de-activated. This is stage 5, which is a transition from operation mode to peace time mode. The cycle is complete.</p>
