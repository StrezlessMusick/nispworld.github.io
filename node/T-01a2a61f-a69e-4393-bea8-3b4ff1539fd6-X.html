  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) Process is drafted here as a generic description, based on an example mission thread definition for Forward Aeromedical Evacuation. Note that some nations use the term Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC). NATO’s medical doctrine defines MEDEVAC as the movement of patients under medical supervision to and between Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs). MEDEVAC is a fundamental aspect of medical support. Movement of casualties is not just transportation to a suitable MTF but is part of a continuum of patient treatment and care, and is therefore, a medical responsibility. At no point in the chain of evacuation must the level of care be reduced below that received at the previous MTF. ‘'’A typical sequence of events’’’ for Forward MEDEVAC  * A casualty occurs at the Point of Injury. * The casualty is reported to a Tactical Operations Centre (TOC). If the respective unit does not have appropriate organic assets to evacuate the casualty, support is requested from higher echelons in the chain of command. * The Theatre Headquarter (HQ) that controls the evacuation assets ** tasks the appropriate unit to conduct the MEDEVAC, ** determines the most appropriate MTF ** and coordinates with all involved actors during execution of the MEDEVAC mission. * The evacuation unit moves to the Point of Injury (or a different, agreed pick-up point). * The evacuation unit evacuates the casualty to the determined MTF and communicates with the MTF to provide best possible preparation of the MTF. * During the whole process, the position of involved actors is tracked, where possible, for situational awareness and effective coordination The mission thread context of an Aeromedical evacuation is illustrated in the figure below. ‘'’Stakeholders ‘’’ * Casualty unit * Evacuation Unit * Evacuation Team * Evacuation Coordinating Officer * Evacuation Liaison Officer * Patient Evacuation Coordination Cell * Medical Treatment Facility ‘'’Information Products needed (input) ‘’’ * status of medical (treatment) facilities  ** location ** the specialist capabilities available and staffing levels, ** medical equipment status, ** current bed occupancy status and any surgical backlog. * status of evacuation assets  ** Location, ** availability, ** medical equipment status * status of patient  ** location, ** The clinical condition of each patient, and any special medical requirements during or after movement; Adequate and complete medical records must be kept on each patient during the entire evacuation process and retained in the patient’s permanent medical record. The Force Commander’s medical staff must at all times have access to relevant data about the health of the command, and the assets available/needed to provide optimum care. Other Operational Relevant Medical Data is also needed, and should be accessible by the MedCIS, including  * Maps of the Area of Operations (AOO); * MTF locations (grid references) and connectivity means (phone and fax number, etc.) * Host Nation Support MTFs (location, phone, fax, capability, comments, etc) * Airfield - helicopter pad characteristics in the AOO (location, phone, length, operation hours, etc.) * National Support Element (NSE) (location, phone, fax, comments and remarks, etc.) Situational Awareness  The current tactical situation and any risk in moving patients or using valuable evacuation assets. In order to direct appropriate assets, reduce response times and have direct communications, an overarching communication plan must be in place, exercised and tested periodically. The Theatre Medical Director coordinates this plan. The Theatre Holding Policy is a command decision indicating the maximum length of time (days) that a patient will be allowed to remain in the theatre for treatment, recovery and return to duty. The medical evacuation process is supported by the tracking process. The tracking process will provide the following information  * Who is the patient? * When was the patient status changed? (This will apply on admission, on transfer and on discharge) * Where is the patient currently located? * What is the patient’s destination (in case of transfer)? ‘'’Systems support’’’ The MEDICS Patient Tracking System (PTS) is to  * Support mission participants with an overview of the location of the patients within the multinational medical support chain; * Contribute to the Common Operational Picture; and * Serve as the basis for Patient Regulation. A PTS should be near-real-time, accurate and dynamic, using standardized procedures and involving HQs J1 staff. A national PTS is any national system that is dealing with the location of patients. For every nation there shall be only one point of data exchange at any time. Alternate points of data exchange are allowed only for the case of communication problems using the primary point. An integrated PTS will offer in-transit visibility of patients and is one of the bases for Patient Regulating.</p>
