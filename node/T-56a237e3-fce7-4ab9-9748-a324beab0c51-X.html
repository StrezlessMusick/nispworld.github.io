  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Strategic Operational Plan (OPLAN) is a plan for a single or series of connected operations to be carried out simultaneously or in succession. It is usually based upon stated assumptions and is the form of directive employed by higher authority to permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting plans and orders. The designation “plan” is usually used instead of “order” in preparing for operations well in advance. An operation plan may be put into effect at a prescribed time, or on signal, and then becomes the operation order (AAP-06). The OPLAN (Operations Plan) is developed (with different emphases and levels of detail) at all levels and includes  * theatre logistics C2 structure, roles and tasks. * the plan for RSOM, identifying deployment critical points * Agreement to bi-lateral and multi-lateral contributions for theatre logistics support in order to provide an early draft of logistics Force Elements. * Multinational support options, i.e. fuel, water, services etc., including identification of HNS and contractual support opportunities * the minimum number of Days of Supply (DOS) for each class of supply that are to be held at each level or line in the JOA. * Committed Logistics Forces * Logistics Information relationships, * Role and Permission definitions/ agreements * Visibility of actors about logistics resources, Requirements and Processes defined, also Authority</p>
