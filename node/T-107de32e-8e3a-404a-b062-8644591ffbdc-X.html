  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Personnel Recovery (PR) Command and Control (C2) Processes are employed by NATO C2 staffs in order to recover and reintegrate personnel who have become isolated or captured. The isolation, capture and/or exploitation of NATO personnel during operations may have a significant negative impact on operational security, morale of assigned forces and public support. In addition, operations may rely on interaction with agencies or other non-NATO actors for which NATO may have a responsibility. NATO has therefore developed a system to recover personnel that have become isolated. Personnel Recovery is a joint function. SACEUR, the Joint Force Commander (JFC) or Joint Task Force (JTF) Commander may delegate a component commander as the Personnel Recovery Coordinator (PRC), who is the commander responsible for planning and coordination of joint PR operations in support of a NATO operation. The PRC will normally designate and establish a Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC) to conduct all PR coordination and provide planning in support of all operational environments where PR operations may be required. Components have responsibility and authority to recover their personnel during an operation. Component recovery conducted unilaterally is the primary method to recover personnel and return them to friendly control. Each component will normally establish a Personnel Recovery Coordination Cell (PRCC) to provide the necessary planning and coordination. When a specific mission exceeds the unilateral capability of a componenet, joint PR missions may be necessary. It is the responsibility of the JPRC and PRCCs to coordinate PR procedures and requirements for operations. Most PR activities extend across component and national lines of responsibility. The availability of recovery assets determines the potential for successfully recovering isolated personnel. No single force, recovery system or organization is suitable for all situations and may require a mix of conventional, unconventional and non-conventional recovery systems. Operational flexibility and multi-system redundancy, along with robust command and control are the primary factors in successful recovery operations.</p>
