  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Air Defence Plan (ADP) is issued by the Air Defence Commander (ADC) to integrate defensive counter-air activities of joint force components in order to achieve operational and tactical objectives. The ADP reflects the Jint Forces Commanderâ€™s priorities. The ADP establishes broad policies and procedures for the coordination and employment of air defences as well as detailed weapons engagement procedures that are applicable to all joint counter-air operations. Joint air defence should aim to integrate the AD capabilities of all components in order to protect and influence the battlespace in line with the campaign plan. The principles of joint air defence are  a. Denial of intelligence to the opponent to mount an attack or to complicate his targeting and control process to the extent that his attacks are ineffective. b. Obtain warning of hostile action by putting in place the means to compile and disseminate a RAP that will facilitate options for the ADC to provide an appropriate response to hostile activity. c. Defence in depth can be achieved through the integration of all air defence systems. The ADC will need to establish coordination measures related to the defensive assets by which hostile attack systems will need to be countered. The number of defensive layers will depend upon the assets available, the C2 infrastructure, the warning time achievable, the threat orientation and the disposition of the joint forces. d. Coordinated AD activity whereby subordinate regional commanders established by the ADC can procedurally exchange the RAP, air battle management information, effect weapons coordination and reduce mutual interference during operations. e. Concentration of effort by means of a coordinated AD design to gain maximum synergy out of joint AD assets and effectively counter the whole spectrum of air threat.</p>
